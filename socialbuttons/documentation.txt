	<link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">

after <script src = "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js" type = "text / javascript"> </ script> for the plugin to work :

$(document).ready(function(){
   <!-- line 1 -->
   $(element id).socialbuttons({'aligment':'left','buttons':["g-plus","facebook","twitter","linkedin"],'effect':'rotate','fixed':'none','look':'square','position':'row',});
   <!-- line 2 -->
